# 3D-extinction-map
Based on the multi-band photometry of SkyMapper Southern Survey, the Two Micron All Sky Survey and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer Survey, we have estimated values of the r-band extinction forâˆ¼ 19 million stars with the spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis. We present a three-dimensional (3D) extinction map of the southern sky.

we also obtain a 3D extinction map that covers the entire sky by combining the maps presented in the current work and those published by Chen et al. (2019) and Green et al. (2018).
