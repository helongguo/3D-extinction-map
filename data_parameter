Coordinate location (“L” and “B”)
Distance (“dis”)
Reddening (“EBV”)
Extinction in the r band (“Ar ”)
The maximum-likelihood (“ χ2 ”)
Corlors (“g_r”, “r_i”, “i_J”, “J_H”, “H_K ”, “K_W1” and “BP_RP ”)
For the reddening “EBV” and “Ar ” in the dataset of “allskymap_EBV.fits” and “SkyMapperAr.fits”, the distance is from 0 to 6 kpc with a bin size of 0.2 kpc.
